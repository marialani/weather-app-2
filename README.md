# Weather App

This project utilises React to build a weather forecast app, displaying a 5-day forecast from a weather API. If a City or Country is not found, it will display an error message to the user. There is also an option to display more details about the forecast for a particular day by clicking the 'more details' button. The components have been tested using the React Testing Library. 
The app has been built using Create-React-App.
